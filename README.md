# **Credit Scoring Model Project**

## **Overview**
This project is part of the 10 Academy Week 6 Challenge and focuses on developing a **Credit Scoring Model** for Bati Bank. The goal is to assess the creditworthiness of customers by analyzing historical transaction data and applying machine learning techniques. This involves building a credit scoring system that categorizes users as high risk (bad) or low risk (good), predicts credit risk probability, and assigns credit scores to new customers.

---

## **Objectives**
1. Define a proxy variable to categorize users as high-risk or low-risk.
2. Engineer meaningful features from the dataset to improve model performance.
3. Develop and evaluate machine learning models for:
   - Assigning risk probabilities.
   - Assigning credit scores based on risk estimates.
   - Predicting optimal loan amounts and durations.
4. Serve the trained models through a REST API for real-time predictions.
5. Apply MLOps principles to ensure reproducibility, scalability, and CI/CD deployment.

## **Setup Instructions**
### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/credit-scoring-project.git
cd credit-scoring-project
```

### **2. Set Up the Environment**
#### Using `pip`:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r environments/requirements.txt
```

#### Using `conda`:
```bash
conda env create -f environments/environment.yml
conda activate credit-scoring
```

### **3. Prepare the Data**
- Place raw data files (e.g., `Train.csv`, `Test.csv`) in the `data/raw/` directory.

### **4. Run the Notebooks**
- Use the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder to explore the data, engineer features, train models, and evaluate results.

### **5. Serve the Model API**
- Use the `src/api.py` file to launch the REST API for real-time predictions:
```bash
python src/api.py
```
